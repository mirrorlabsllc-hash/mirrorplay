# Mirror Play

Mirror Play is a voice-first, AI-powered practice environment designed to help users explore communication patterns in a playful, low-stakes way.

This repository contains the core application code for **Mirror Play**, a product developed under **Mirror Labs Co**.

## 🧠 What Mirror Play Is

Mirror Play provides short, guided interaction prompts that allow users to:
- Practice responding to everyday communication scenarios
- Explore tone, wording, and emotional framing
- Reflect on how different responses may be perceived

The experience is intentionally **lightweight, non-judgmental, and exploratory**.

> Mirror Play is not therapy, counseling, or medical software.  
> It is a practice and reflection tool.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

- **Play over performance** – no “right” answers
- **Practice without pressure** – low stakes, repeatable interactions
- **Awareness, not correction** – feedback is descriptive, not prescriptive
- **Voice-first UX** – speaking is primary; text is secondary

---

## 🧩 Key Features (Current)

- Voice-based interaction flow
- Scenario-driven prompts
- Optional reflective feedback
- Gamified progression mechanics
